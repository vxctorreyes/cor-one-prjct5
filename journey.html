      <p class="journeytext"> I have been on an educational path for most of my life, and because of this, my curiosity and interest in learning have brought me to software development. Looking back, I've realized that I have always been interested in the field. In high school, I took a computer software class where we learned all the physical components of a computer and built our own. In college, I took some engineering and computer science classes as well. I was never able to fully committee until now. I have decided to embark on this learning journey into the tech world by getting certificates and self-learning programming to then one day turn all of this into a career. </p>
