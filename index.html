        <p>Hi, my name is Victor Reyes.</p>
        <p> I am 22 years old and was born in San Diego, California. I lived there for my whole life up until I was 16. When I was 16, my family and I decided to move to Arizona, which was pretty interesting because the weather and social life of the state are rather different compared to San Diego. </p>
        <p> I graduated from Paradise Valley High School in 2019. Soon after enrolled in Estrella Mountain Community College. My curiosity and interests lead me to study both, some mechanical engineering and for the most part business. Which then lead me to get my associate's in business. Currently, at this point in life, I have become very interested in the tech industry where I truly see myself building a career. This interest has brought me to Correlation-One, CS50, and other self-learning programming where I'm learning and earning certifications in software development/engineering. </p>

      <p class="journeytext"> I have been on an educational path for most of my life, and because of this, my curiosity and interest in learning have brought me to software development. Looking back, I've realized that I have always been interested in the field. In high school, I took a computer software class where we learned all the physical components of a computer and built our own. In college, I took some engineering and computer science classes as well. I was never able to fully committee until now. I have decided to embark on this learning journey into the tech world by getting certificates and self-learning programming to then one day turn all of this into a career. </p>
